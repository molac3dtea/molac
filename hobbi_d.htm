In the history 200 Chinese shipwrecked people of Golden Adventurer Ship came to a prison when they stranded near banks of USA in 1993. <br>
The one of them ripped for equal half-palmful pieces the colour newspapers and other wastepapers in his leisure moments. After he folded these pieces for uniform triangular elements.<br>
He put together the complicated shapes from thise simple elements.<br>
Then he familiarized the other prisoners with the folding. So the quantity of the component parts increased quickly.<br>
Finally the paper sculptures (vases, pots, animals) came to museums and galleries from the prison.<br>
The model make me remember the Chinese sacrificial paper-money folding which was used in funeral rites.
